# cFS-Training

These activities show the results obtained when using a specific version of cFS, using a point-in-time version of the build environment on the BeagleBone AI. In particular these activities are based on cFS version 6.7.3 with additional changes applied. You can, and likely should, use a more recent version of cFS with an expectation there will be differences in the results. Similarly, using different build tool versions, which are continuously updated, may result in additional differences.

These activities apply to cFS on the BeagleBone AI. Other Linux-based computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, should also work, again expecting differences.

The results of each activity are saved as a Git tag of the form Activity01 through Activity11. These tags reflect the state of the repository at the conclusion of each activity.
